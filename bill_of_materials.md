Return to [Edge Lab Overview](README.md) 

List of needed items for the Edge Lab with prices and links for ordering. 

We recommend a four Raspberry Pi system, but two is the minimum.

Weâ€™re offering multiple configurations based on your desktop real estate.  For starters, we recommend the Simple PoE since it reduces wiring; however, ordering the Cloudlet without the case is a less expensive option.

NOTES:
* The RPi 4B with 4GB RAM is the required minimum specification.  The Edge Lab design requires features of this model and in memory boot plus application requires 4 GB of RAM.
* The RPi 4B draws 3.4 watts so plan for 5 watts per RPi when designing USB or PoE power.

Simple Stack with Power over Ethernet (PoE, approx $500)
----

This approach minimizes the amount of cables by using power over ethernet.
